### Autonomous_Robot_Verilog
An project built to control a robot autonomously via an RS-232 interface. The project was written in verilog, and designed to control a Clearpath Husky UGV robot. First, the RS-232 read/write interface of the program was built. Then using the API interface documents of the robot, commands were created in the verilog program in order to tell the robot how to move.
